# AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification - My Journey to 821

## Introduction

This repo documents my journey to achieving a score of 821 on the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam. Hope these materials & approach help others ace the exam.

## Background
i have worked with data related services of AWS before, but this exam needs a knowledge of various concepts like security, governance and compliance that were new to me, so i started with general training.

## Study Approach

My study approach consisted of the following key elements:

1. **AWS skill builder**: first i went through the official free long course, containing most of the cloud concepts and took notes [[here](https://github.com/BabakBar/AWS-Cloud-Practitioner-Exam/blob/main/AWS%20Essentials.pdf)](link). gave me a nice idea of the whole aws cloud environment.
3. **Tools used**: uploaded the notes to NotebookLM and it was nice to listen to the generated podcast, you can also ask related questions; it has a reliable RAG for these questions. Another thing you can do is to upload all the notes or resources to a Claud Project or Custome GPT, and ask for further explanations or a breakdown of topics.
4. **Practice tests**: I took Tutorials Dojo mock exams, really helpful and similar vibe to the exam. way harder than actual exam, my results were 56, 63, 66, 75, and 69 with the mocks. Definitely helpful when you do in style of exam.
5. **Deep dives**: For complex topics, i watched extra youtube videos like the networking part to get a better understanding.
